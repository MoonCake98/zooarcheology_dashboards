The dataset we begin with is the [Domuztepe Excavations](https://opencontext.org/projects/e6fb0f7c-6f69-6ca8-683b-8c6d5e98a099) dataset, this dataset contains the objects and zooarcheological features found at the Domuztepe Excavation site. The dataset contains a variety of data about these objects including the wgs formatted coordinates the object was found at, the dating, the item category and many more such things.\n",

As of the writing of this my contact person has not had contact with our client yet but has stated that he is in the process of contacting our client. So after consulting with the contact person I have gained approval for developement of the data dashboard using this dataset."
